Courts to resolve any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, the Site or the

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL JORGE ALEGRE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND

AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES (ALL OF THE FOREGOING, COLLECTIVELY, THE “JORGE ALEGRE PARTIES”) BE 
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY 
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PERSONAL OR BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS

EXCEED 100€. YOU AGREE TO USE YOUR BEST EFFORTS TO MITIGATE ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES YOU MAY SUFFER IN 
CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE AND THE CONTENT.

Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or 
incidental damages, parts of the above limitation may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, the 
liability of the Jorge Alegre Parties shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable 
law. Check your local laws for any restrictions or limitations regarding the limitation of liability 
for consequential or incidental damages.

employees, agents and representatives from and against any and all claims, actions, losses, damages, 
liabilities, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable 
attorneys’ fees and court costs) arising out of or relating to (a) your breach of these Terms or any 
applicable laws or regulations, (b) your access to or use of the Site and/or the Content, (c) your 
violation, breach or misappropriation of a third party’s copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret,

damages, liabilities, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses shall be your sole responsibility.

13. **MISCELLANEOUS**

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the access to or use of the 
Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a 
waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have 
no legal or contractual effect. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be 
invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or 
unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum 
extent permitted by law.
